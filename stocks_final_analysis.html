        <h4>Conclusions: A Final Analysis and Overview</h4>
        <p>
            As can be seen from this presentation, while the five stocks we have studied are all based in the defense industry, they do not necessarily exhibit uniform trends with respect to price, return, or volume.
            Furthermore, we cannot easily conclude that changes in military spending between presidential administrations substantially affect the stocks.
            Thus, in the long run, the contractors' tendencies appear to be immune from daily political developments for the most part.
            The differences between the contractors become more obvious when we turn toward our case study.
        </p>
        <p>
            Although the stock market itself is not the strongest indicator of economic growth in the US, it is a reflection of corporations' profit potential.
            As with any stock, any observations on the contractors' prices, returns, and volumes should account for their current financial status, along with recent corporate developments.
            Hence, an investor interested in trading within the defense industry has a range of options while deciding how much volatility he is willing to tolerate.
        </p>
        <p>
            As we can tell from in our case study, individual years alone cannot tell the whole picture on how a stock will perform.
            Nowhere is this clearer when analyzing General Dynamics.
            As we saw earlier, while in 1991 it posted the greatest annual return (110.78%) for any point within our time span, on average annually it performed lower than Boeing and Lockheed Martin.
            Since stocks by their very nature are more volatile than bonds, any years in the red can limit a stock's scope of growth and return for an investor.
            This observation further strengthens the argument that holding on to a stock for a while, rather than trading frequently to capitalize on gains within the market, may ultimately offer an investor a greater return on his portfolio.
            In addition, it reiterates how stocks have historically outperformed bonds in the long run despite their higher volatility.
            Of course, a declining economy can encourage investors to temporarily allocate a greater portion of their portfolios toward bonds to minimize their losses.
        </p>
        <p>
            Given the current conditions of monetary policy in the US, where interest rates are quite low from a historical perspective, the trend of stocks outperforming bonds will likely continue for now.
            That being said, corrections in the market are inevitable if economists and investors deduce there is a significant risk for inflation.
            Amid the rise of the COVID-19 pandemic, inflation and a decline in business nationwide have threatened the economy.
            Left unattended, the long-term ramifications for excessive inflation could especially be disastrous for investors in the market.
        </p>
        <p>
            With the respect to the contractors themselves, an investor willing to embrace higher volatility may opt to buy shares of Boeing.
            While Boeing did not post the highest daily volume on average, it did report the greatest number of days where its volume exceeded 50 million.
            It likewise demonstrated the greatest variability with respect to its daily price ranges, along with the highest beta since 2016 of all the stocks in our list.
            We noted as well how for eight of the ten days where its volume relatively rose the quickest, it witnessed declines in its return.
            This and the aforementioned note suggest that higher volumes for Boeing typically witness more polarized returns.
        </p>
        <p>
            In contrast, a more conservative investor may choose to buy shares of Lockheed Martin upon observing how its return has dropped by more than 20% only once since 1999.
            The lone occurence (-20.51%) came in 2008 amid the financial crisis, in a year where the other contractors likewise saw declines.
            In extension, since 2016 Lockheed Martin posted a beta of 0.801, indicating slightly more stable returns when compared to the S&P 500.
            According to Morningstar, among the contractors in our list it has recently reported the highest forward dividend yield, another attraction for a potential investor.
            Notwithstanding this and the former observation, it is up to any investor's discretion on what and how he is willing to trade in the stock market, under the knowledge of the risks and rewards his investment entails.
            Fortunately, given the contractors' strong corporate standing as of late, in the long run they are each likely to provide investors with steady income, under the observation that their biggest customer continues to be the US government.
            Furthermore, as we picked up in the first section of our case study, each of the stocks posted higher average annual returns on their investments than the S&P 500 (10.07%) over our time span.
        </p>

            This presentation was a terrific opportunity to apply the techniques of visualization with Google API programming to gain insights on how each of the contractors performed in the stock market from 1985 to 2021.
